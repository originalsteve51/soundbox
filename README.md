# soundbox
This is a Raspberry Pi based sound player intended for use by young people in a learning environment.

The code runs in the context of a hardware device I have made. This includes six buttons and five leds that are accessed using the Pi GPIO library. A sound card from Adafruit is accessed using ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) apis. Eventually I may include the electrical design here, but that depends on time.
